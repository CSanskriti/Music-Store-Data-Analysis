# Music Store Data Analysis using SQL
## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a Music Store's data using SQL. The primary goal is to gain insights into the store's music collection and customer interactions through database queries. The project was developed using SQL and Visual Studio as the development tools.

## Project Components
Development Tools:
SQL
Visual Studio
## Features
Database Schema Creation: The project involves the creation of a SQL database schema for the Music Store, including the necessary database tables.

SQL Queries for Analysis: Several SQL queries have been developed to analyze the Music Store's data. These queries include:

Track Names with Greater Than Average Song Length: This query identifies tracks in the music collection with a song length greater than the average song length.

Top 3 Value Invoices: This query retrieves the top three invoices with the highest total value.

Additional Queries (Question Sets):

Question Set 2 – Moderate:

Query 1: Write a query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
Query 2: Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.
Query 3: Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first.
Question Set 3 – Advanced:

Query 1: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name, and total spent.
Query 2: We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared, return all Genres.
Query 3: Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.
